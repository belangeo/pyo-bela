fx-ring-mod.py - Stereo ring modulator.

This example shows how to build a ring modulation effect 
with modulator's frequency and brightness controlled by
analog inputs (use audio inputs after the stereo audio
channels, ie. Input(2) is analog-in 0, Input(3) is 
analog-in 1, etc.).

It also show how to send signal to analog outputs. Again,
use the outputs after the stereo audio channels, ie.
.out(2) writes to analog-out 0, .out(3) to analog-out 1,
etc.).
